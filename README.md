haplohseq
=========

Haplohseq is a tool for identifying regions of allelic imbalance in sequence
data obtained from impure samples.

This is a slightly modified source tree to faciliate packaging in FreeBSD
ports, pkgsrc, and similar package managers.

The official download site is scheet.org/software.html to obtain haplohseq.

See https://sites.google.com/site/integrativecancergenomics/software/haplohseq for documentation.
